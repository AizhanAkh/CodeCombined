###### heat exchange rate prescription ####
dmeff_baryon_heat_exchange = yes ##If set to no, the heat exchange is neglected for both fluid. Default is yes.
dmeff_backrection_on_baryons = no ##If set to no, the baryon heat exchange term is neglected. Default is no.
calculation_a_la_dvorkin_et_al = no ##If set to yes, we sum the thermal velocities and relative velocities. ##UPDATE: no more artifical bug is introduced. Default is no.
###### if all is set to no: hypergeometric functions are used and temperatures are evaluated in each species rest-frame

###### velocity treatment (for heat exchange rate) #####
Vrel_dmeff_rate = 30 ##in km/s. Use a broken power law whose normalisation is given by Vrel_dmeff_rate. Set to 30 to get the standard LCDM value. Careful: default is 0.

###### momentum exchange rate prescription #####
# Two possible prescriptions (incompatible with calculation_a_la_dvorkin_et_al), involving
# Vrms(k,z), Vflow(k,z), and Vfull(z) (full variance, integrated over all k).
# In both cases, Vfull(z) and Vrms(k,z) for all k are initialized to Vrel_dmeff_rate with a broken power law,
# while Vflow=0, and the temperature and perturbations module are solved once.
# Setting dmeff_niter_dynamic_max>1 will feedback the computed Vrms, Vflow, and Vfull values in perturbations
# to recompute thermodynamics and perturbations with these updated values.

# If calculation_a_la_dvorkin_et_al and the prescriptions below are set to no,
# no modification of the momentum-transfer rate is made.

dmeff_Vrms_dynamic = yes ##If set to yes, use k-dependent Vrms and Vflow to modify momentum-transfer rate. Must ask for mPk in the output, and k_max must be at least 1. Default is no.
dmeff_Vfull_dynamic = no ##If set to yes, use Vfull (variance integrated over all k) to modify momentum-transfer rate, in a manner similar to DKB (note that the temperature evolution will differ from DBK). Default is no.

dmeff_niter_dynamic_max = 10 ##How many iterations to go through to get Vflow or Vrms to converge. Default is 3.
Vrms_convergence_tol = 1e-3 ## Convergence test for the iterating Vrms/Vfull. Iterations are stopped if the required convergence is reached. default = 1e-3 
##### other flags ###
# These are independent of all flags relating to relative bulk velocity treatments.
dmeff_interacting_species = hydrogen ## Choose DM to interact with hydrogen (neutral and ionized), ionized (free electrons and protons, but not ionized helium), and baryons (all baryons). Default is hydrogen.
Tracy_and_Cora_Helium = no ## If yes, fix the helium mass fraction to 0.24 in scattering rate calculation only. If no, set it to the value used by CLASS. Default is no.
z_rate_off_dmeff = 0 ## Vera's test parameter of turning off interaction at some value of z. Default is 0.
sigma_dmeff_security = yes ##enforce to use DBK prescription above some sigma that depends on the mass: 100keV = 1e-30 cm^2, 1MeV = 1e-32cm^2, 10MeV = 1e-34cm^2. allows to run up to (and including) ~100keV = 1e-26 cm^2, 1MeV = 1e-28cm^2, 10MeV = 1e-31cm^2.
